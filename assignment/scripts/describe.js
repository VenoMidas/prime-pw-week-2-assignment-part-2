// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening. 
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// we create a variable called name and give it a string value of Dane
// then check to see if name (Dane) is equal to Mary
// if yes, log Hi, Mary
//if no, log How do you do? - this is expected outcome

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// create a variable called secret with no value and create a variable called code and 
// give number value of 123. if code is equal to 123, give secret a string value of 
// super, and multiply code by 2 and assign new value to code (246). then if code is
// greater than 250 change secret value to a string of 'duper' then log value of secret
// expect outcome to be "super"

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// create variable isStudent with boolean true, var age with number value 34, var zip 
// with number value 55407. check student is true or false AND zip is greater than 80000
// log statement or else if not a student and age is less than 30 log statement or else 
// is a student true log statement, finaly if all the above is false, log last statement
// expected "Welcome to Prime!"

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;

  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);

  console.log('Welcome to Prime!');
} else {
  console.log('How about the weather?')
}

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code. 
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment. 
// Should be number++.
number--; 

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and 
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true 
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*
// colorOne and colorTwo values are flipped
let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;

//only has colorOne = purple, need to add colorTwo = 'purple';
if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple';
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4 
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;

//need to switch || (or) to && (and) as described
//also time is set as a const, so it will always be greater than 4.
//if it should be const, could remove the time condition, otherwise 
//change const to let to allow for change after init
if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

/*
let age = 21;
const minAge = 21;

// while technically checks the same thing it is flipped from description
// change to (age >= minAge)
// ultimatly the issue is the log result, flip the results so the first log is 'enter' 
// and the second log is 'no entry'
if(minAge <= age) {
  console.log('no entry');
} else {
  console.log('enter');
